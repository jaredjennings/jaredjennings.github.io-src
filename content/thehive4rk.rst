[Edited several hours later: clarified some terms and improved flow.]

`TheHive <https://thehive-project.org/>`_ purports to provide
"security incident response for the masses." It's "designed to make
life easier for [security operations centers], [computer security
incident response teams], [computer emergency response teams] and any
information security practitioner dealing with security incidents that
need to be investigated and acted upon swiftly."

`StrangeBee <https://www.strangebee.com/>`_, the company set up by the
creators of TheHive, `announced
<https://medium.com/strangebee-announcements/thehive-turns-5-and-adopts-a-model-shaped-for-the-future-95f908719c31>`_
that TheHive 5 would not be Free Software nor open-source software,
and that they would stop maintaining TheHive 4 at the end of 2022. You
should go read their blog articles, and if you want to pay someone to
maintain your software rather than taking part yourself, you should
consider paying them money. If your needs are small enough, perhaps
their free-to-use offering will do what you need. But "incident
response for the masses" should continue, and that will happen by
forking TheHive 4. This means continuing to use and improve the
version that's under a Free Software license.

So I'll just click the "fork" button in GitHub, and voila, I'm
doneâ€”right? In fact, 500 people have done that before me, so why write
a blog post about it? Well, this blog post is one initial part of the
difference: I'm asking you to join me if you care about open-source
security incident response. And it takes time to build a community, so
we have to get started now.

If you read my earlier blog posts, you can see I have some ideas and
wishes about where to take TheHive and its friends. But it's important
that we talk about those together. I can't do it all alone. The
original creators faced burnout, and their answer was to raise the
asking price of their time. That is their prerogative! But they also
allowed for the community to take up TheHive4 and run with it. If you
want to do that, I want to help.

The provisional name of this effort is "TheHive4rk," pronounced "the
hive fork," in tribute to the creators and history of the project. The
demands of trademark law and of courtesy will probably cause the name
to change quickly.

Please join `TheHive4rk Matrix space
<https://matrix.to/#/#thehive4rk:lurk.agrue.info>`_ and let's talk
about a community-built future of security incident response.
