OK so I'm making this ergonomic keyboard. And I've also been learning the Colemak layout. But I discovered that my wrists hurt more when typing with Colemak. Quite unexpected. I noticed myself using my pinkies more, reaching with my right index finger more, and spending more time on the home row, which is unnatural for me. I usually have my fingers resting on (left from pinky to index) Caps, W, E, F, (right from pinky to index) apostrophe, O, I, J. I told the `keyboard analysis tool <https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/analyze.html>`_ which fingers I really think I use, and took a stab at effort numbers. With this, it gave my QWERTY typing a score of 2.328, Colemak 2.237, and Mod-DH 2.171. With the usual finger usages, Colemak scores 1.4 (lower is better). This means that for me, on a normal keyboard, Colemak is not a significant win.

With the skeleton of my new keyboard, with its column staggering both in the y and z directions, my fingers do rest on the traditional home row. I bet Colemak will be much nicer on that keyboard.

A thing I've never seen that would help greatly in such an analysis as this would be something that captures keystrokes and video, and determines which finger was touching a key at the time the keystroke happened. I don't think I nearly always use the same finger for the same key, and the keyboard layout analyzer can't analyze that. And I totally guessed at the effort figures; video with analysis could make that much more empirical.
