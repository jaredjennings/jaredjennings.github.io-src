How to make a Dactyl Manuform.

 1. Choose a size. Modify source accordingly.
 2. Comment out nubs. (I am using Kailh switches.)
 3. Slice using Cura, not Slic3r.
 4. Print (15 hours per half at 0.3mm per layer).
 5. Laboriously remove support. Use pliers on main support structure, and pointed stainless steel spudger from iFixit, sometimes whacked with a screwdriver handle, for interfacing.
 6. Sand. (Optional, but for one side I didn't have Cura dialed in yet and it had zits.)
 7. Find out tshort decided to use a USB-A socket; decide against this. Micro-B isn't all that bad. Buy ASIN B00B5HSC20 short micro USB extenders.
 8. Use a razor blade to shave socket down to USB-A size. Hold work in a vise not a hand!
 9. Use a razor blade to shave strain relief on plug to enable tight corner.
 10. File down RJ-11 socket (Mouser; FIXME part number?)
 11. Print a `sanding stick <https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3280123>`_.
 12. Spray with filling primer. Sand. Repeat.
