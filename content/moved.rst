I've moved to Pittsburgh, and obtained a job at Peoples Natural Gas as a
cybersecurity analyst. This is so far rather less focused on the details
of compliance on individual hosts, and more on the whole organization,
the whole networks, people, and the policies people follow. This may
mark a change in thinking, and thus in what is written to enable that
thinking.
