At least temporarily, I've turned back to an old project to back up
files onto redundant arrays of optical discs.
`activity <https://github.com/jaredjennings/darbrrb/issues/2>`__.

It looks like I can't both use the PAR2 file format and use Gibraltar,
which is a library that uses the GPU to calculate redundancy data really
quickly.
