Xah has started to post videos on his Emacs blog. And I
watched "playing Emacs like an instrument," and watched part of
the Emacs Chat episode with Xah, and "the editor of a lifetime."

I've also listened to many Emacs Chat episodes as podcasts, audio
only. Now I can say that watching people use Emacs fluidly has
made me want to make my Emacs nicer in a way that only listening
didn't. It's uncanny.

Today I started to try to make Emacs generate tags files, so that
jumping to the definition of something from a call to it will
work right. I did it by pasting code, then found out that there
have since been packages made that make it nicer.

I've been annoyed to have to use C-x C-b to list my buffers
because Xah didn't make a keyboard shortcut for it, but watching
his command-log scroll by on his video I saw he uses IBuffer, and
he did make a keyboard shortcut for that, and it's much better. I
had no idea!
