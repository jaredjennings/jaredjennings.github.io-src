I've moved the font customizations I made for this blog into a child
theme, after learning that Wordpress has these things called child
themes, and after a Wordpress upgrade took out the changes I had made in
an ad-hoc fashion. `The GitLab
repo <https://gitlab.com/jaredjennings/wordpress-theme-twenty-fifteen-c64-child>`__.
