Requiem for TheHive4rk

It's 31 December 2022. This is the previously slated end of support
for TheHive 4. I `opined`_ six months ago that TheHive 4 should
continue, and that I'd lead that continuation if I were not alone in
it.

.. _opined: fork-thehive-4.html

Before and since, I thought about what would need to happen to make
such a continuation work. And I avoided actually doing most of those
things.

What I did do was to set up a place to discuss those things: a Matrix
server. Discussions related to TheHive take place on a Discord
"server," and the lowest-friction option was to start another one.
But Matrix was a way to be more open and less centralized.

I failed to trumpet the project from the housetops. I didn't do a talk
at `my local BSides conference`_, I didn't get stickers in time to
share them there, I showed up at about none of the `BarSides`_ meetups
through 2022, and I didn't try to make a big splash in TheHive
Discord. I'm pretty sure I didn't even get Matrix federation working
properly till a couple of weeks ago.

On my Matrix server, I spoke with a grand total of: Nabil Adouani. Hi
Nabil! Thanks for joining. When you announced on TheHive Discord that
TheHive5 was going closed source, you mentioned that not one person
outside StrangeBee had contributed any code to TheHive4 over its whole
life. That cast serious doubt on the size of a potential TheHive4
maintenance community. But I didn't want to take your word for it.

Over 2022, besides Discord getting naggier, GitHub Copilot also kind
of blew up, Gitea sprouted a company and was promptly forked as
Forgejo, and Akka went closed-source. (TheHive and Cortex are built
with the Play Framework, which is built on top of Akka.)

I still think that "security incident response for the masses," using
Free Software, is a thing that should happen. But I'm not sure TheHive
4 is the code base those masses should gather around, and I'm probably
not the person to gather them together.

But if you want to talk about it, you can still join `the Matrix space
<https://matrix.to/#/#thehive4rk:lurk.agrue.info>`_.
