After booting up the Hurd in a VM (it works, and thanks to Debian has
lots of software, but no 64-bit, no NX-protection, and no community to
add them), and poking through editors provided by pkgsrc in NetBSD, I
came upon conglomerate, an attempt to make structured,
non-WYSIWYG-but-graphical document editing, specifically in XML and
mostly with DocBook, something that anyone could do. Last touched in
2005, stored in CVS, built against Gnome 2.4.

This, after speaking with an old colleague about my own project in
structured documentation, CMITS, and the visions I had for its future,
where it would no longer be confined to a single big document, nor yet
to a single system configuration management product—but, as I couldn't
see at the time, would likely have ended up confined to a single
implementer.

Compound this with a tour through Advogato, Kuro5hin, and Everything2,
and the same sense of loss now pervades as I used to feel after
reading papers and books about RDF, all several years old, all excited
about the future where we would share more and know more—and, after
that, nothing.
