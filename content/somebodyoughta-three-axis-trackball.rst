Somebodyoughta make a trackball that can tell when I twist the ball as
well as when I roll it.

EDITED TO ADD: I posted this in a hurry, from my phone, without taking
the time to find out whether someone had `already done
it <https://vimeo.com/69113731>`__. And while searching I found a
wonderful site I had forgotten about, `the
Halfbakery <http://www.halfbakery.com/idea/Three_20axis_20trackball>`__.
