`Katello <http://katello.org>`__ helps you create local Yum and Puppet
repositories, obtain updates to packages in these repositories, and make
the updates available in a controlled fashion. It's also hooked into
`Foreman <http://theforeman.org>`__ for provisioning.
`Landscape <http://www.ubuntu.com/management/landscape-features>`__
seems to do similar things for Ubuntu.

But there are so many kinds of repositories. Gem repositories, PyPI
mirrors, `Maven artifact
repositories <https://maven.apache.org/repository-management.html>`__,
Eclipse plugins... well, you can't really start a new language these
days without an add-on repo for itâ€”Go, Rust, Haskell, Clojure...

Every one worth its salt lets you set up your own repository of its kind
of thing. But nothing I've heard of lets you set up a repository for any
and all of these, and control them in one place. Somebodyoughta make
that thing. I don't care how hard it is.
