Thinner marshmallow, fall 2019

Disillusioned with my failure to make a keyboard bottom out of pieces
that could be precisely glued together, and possessed of a printer
with a square print volume, I printed an entire Dactyl Marshmallow
bottom, legs, screw thingies and all, in one piece in June. Screwing
the frame on, I immediately perceived that the assemblage was way too
thick.

Now, revisiting it after a while away, I can see that the problem is I
made two marshmallows. The one for the sides is a pairwise hulling of
shapes around the edge of the keyboard; the one for the bottom is a
gridwise hulling of shapes under each key, *but not extending out to
the sides*. This makes the bottom marshmallow start to slope up before
reaching the side marshmallow. Previously I just pushed the bottom
marshmallow down until the edges met.

But what I need is a single marshmallow, encompassing all the shapes
around the sides and the shapes under the keys. Then there will be a
contiguous surface on the bottom.
