So this is the blog where I commune with my past and future selves. A
story: Once I filed an issue against a piece of software I had written,
about the need to redesign it to be orders of magnitude faster. That
ticket has over 100 comments, all from me, over the span of two years
and more. The redesign happened, and the software was much faster, but
it was harder to test, debug and reason about. When I handed it off to a
new maintainer, he deemed it not maintainable enough, so we trashed it.
The end.
