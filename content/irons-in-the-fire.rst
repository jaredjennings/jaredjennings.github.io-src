Right now, I'm:

-  digitizing something like 100 LP records, in the highest-quality way
   I can.
-  reviving an electric organ from the '60s as a MIDI keyboard
   controller. (`info <http://j.agrue.info/reorg>`__)
-  writing `a script <http://github.com/jaredjennings/darbrrb/>`__ to
   back up files onto Blu-Ray discs using
   `dar <http://dar.sourceforge.net/>`__ and
   `par2 <http://parchive.sourceforge.net/>`__. (It's looking like it'll
   be using `Gibraltar <http://www.cs.sandia.gov/Scalable_IO/>`__ too.)
-  building `Boot2Gecko <https://wiki.mozilla.org/B2G>`__ (better known,
   but trademarked, as `Firefox OS <http://mozilla.org/firefox/os/>`__)
   for my Galaxy Nexus. (It's a *toro* model, not a *maguro*.)
-  trying to figure out how the computer security goodness of
   `STIGs <http://iase.disa.mil/stigs/>`__ can be put to good use by
   more people than it is now.
-  thinking about designing an entropy generator like the `Simtec
   Electronics Entropy Key <http://entropykey.co.uk/>`__, but able to be
   procured.
