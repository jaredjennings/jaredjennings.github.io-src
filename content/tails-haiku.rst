`Tails <http://tails.boum.org/>`__ is a live DVD or thumbdrive image
based on `Debian Live <http://live.debian.net/>`__, which routes all
your network traffic while you are using it through the
`Tor <http://torproject.org/>`__ anonymity network. It's slick, it's
secure, but it's slow to boot.

`Haiku <http://haiku-os.org/>`__ is a desktop operating system inspired
by the BeOS. It's small, it's fast, it needs all the users and
developers it can get. Haiku hasn't got a lot of applications; but Tails
doesn't need a lot of applications. Tails needs to be as small as
possible for security; Haiku is as small as possible for simplicity.

I'm on too many things already to do it myself just now; perhaps I'll
fill you in on those later. But someone should make this.
