I've been learning about `Linked Data <http://linkeddata.org/>`__
lately, along with other related concepts like RDF, RDFS, OWL, and
SPARQL, and having a lot of fun with it. I think it's quite promising,
which is a silly statement to make because it's already doing a lot of
work for many people: it's `warning people about credit card
fraud <http://www.garlik.com/>`__, `cataloging sports
stats <http://www.bbc.com/sport/>`__, and `composing DuckDuckGo
zero-click results and Google Cards <http://schema.org/>`__ (kinda).
It's been through three names (RDF, Semantic Web, Linked Data) already.
But it seems like all the books written on it are ten years old, and
some decent number of websites critical to its community are offline.
After receiving a timeout while connecting to
`CKAN <http://ckan.net/>`__, I suddenly thought of
`Ozymandias <http://www.online-literature.com/shelley_percy/672/>`__.
But perhaps the `Kangbashi New
Area <http://gizmodo.com/welcome-to-the-worlds-largest-ghost-city-ordos-china-1541512511>`__
is a better analogy: unlike Ozymandias' works, it still stands, but few
inhabit it.
