Reorg is my project to rejuvenate an electric organ from the 1970s as a
MIDI keyboard controller, overengineering everything along the way. It
lives in this `Darcs repository <http://hub.darcs.net/jaredj/reorg>`__.
The products of it so far are two printed circuit boards which look like
these: `1 <https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/54hcQB6G>`__,
`2 <https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/Ae2xbqeW>`__.
